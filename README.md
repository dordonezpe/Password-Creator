# Password-Creator
Password Creator is my first program in Python. 
It allows you to create a encrypted password through A1z26 and Atbash cypher. 
Follow these steps: 
 1. Write a phrase you like. 
 2. Recieve your password. 
Simply as that. The program change the characters of your phrase to create a bizarre 
password hard to recognize for a person who don't knows these cyphers, how they works and
how it's composed in your password.
