# Password-Creator
Hey, I'm David.

Password Creator is my first program in Python. 
It allows you to create a encrypted password through A1z26 and Atbash cipher. 
Follow these steps: 
 1. Write a phrase you like. 
 2. Recieve your password. 
Simply as that. The program change the characters of your phrase to create a bizarre 
password hard to recognize for a person who don't knows these ciphers. You can always 
ask another password without exit of the program.
